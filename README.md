# HardBop Engine

<p>
 It's not a trivial work to produce a multiplatform software that works with Unix/Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.
Many game engines multiple platforms more than that though, they are very complex and huge to use for casual applications.

<p>
 This project is created for my personal software development and testing bed for study and experiments. Therefore, it
should be simple and easy to learn and use if users are familiar with standard C/C++ library.
