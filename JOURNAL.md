## Summary of Macro Application Task

Applied the new macros from `Engine/Core/CommonMacros.h` across the codebase:
- `returnIf(condition)` for `if (condition) return;`
- `returnValueIf(value, condition)` for `if (condition) return value;`
- `breakIf(condition)` for `if (condition) break;`
- `continueIf(condition)` for `if (condition) continue;`
- `ONCE()` macro kept in CommonMacros.h (removed duplicate from CommonUtil.h)

### Changes Made

1. **Engine/Core/CommonMacros.h**: Added `returnValueIf` macro.
2. **Engine/Core/CommonUtil.h**: Removed duplicate `ONCE` macro definition.
3. Applied macros to 34 files across Container, Math, OSAL, Resource, String, Logger, ComponentSystem, TaskSystem, etc.
4. Added `#include "Core/CommonMacros.h"` to each modified file.
5. Verified that all 51 unit tests pass.

### Lines Saved Estimate

- Approximately 103 macro applications replaced 2-line patterns with 1-line equivalents, saving ~103 lines.
- Added 34 include lines (one per modified file).
- Removed 1 duplicate macro line from CommonUtil.h.
- **Net lines saved**: 103 - 34 + 1 = **70 lines**.

### Verification

- Built and ran EngineTest in Debug configuration: all tests pass.
- No regressions introduced.

## RingQueue Performance Optimization & Quaternion Test Fix

### Changes Made

1. **Engine/Container/RingQueue.h**:
   - Added `#include <bit>` for `std::bit_ceil()`
   - Modified constructor to round capacity to next power of 2 using `std::bit_ceil()`
   - Changed `WrapIndex` from modulo (`% cap`) to bitmask (`& (cap - 1)`)
3. **Engine/Math/Quaternion.cpp**:
   - Previous expectation was mathematically invalid (rotating vector parallel to axis of rotation)

## EngineTest Performance Analysis and Improvement Solutions

### Summary
Built and ran Applications/EngineTest in Debug configuration with tests enabled. Identified performance warnings where custom implementations underperform STL equivalents.

### Key Findings
- InlinePoolAllocator: 1.27x slower than system malloc for variable-sized allocations (due to fallback overhead)
- MultiPoolAllocator: 7.7x slower than std::malloc
- ThreadSafeMultiPoolAllocator: 8.0x slower than std::malloc
- LinkedList: 2.1x slower than std::list
- String: 14x slower than std::string (due to lack of Small String Optimization)

### Recommended Solutions
1. **InlinePoolAllocator**: Document as fixed-size only; use segregated allocators for variable sizes.
2. **MultiPoolAllocator**: Optimize block management (power-of-two sizes, per-CPU caching); reduce lock contention.
3. **LinkedList**: Integrate node pooling; cache size; use sentinel node.
4. **String**: Implement Small String Optimization (SSO); exponential growth; optimize operations.

### Next Steps
- Start with String SSO for highest impact.
- Proceed to LinkedList node pooling.
- Address allocators last due to complexity.
- Create microbenchmarks to validate improvements.

## Refactor: Static multi-platform (Application + Window) — Steps A & B

### Summary
Replaced runtime polymorphism with static compile-time dispatch, per user directive.

- **Step A (`ea01c87`)** — Application: dropped `IApplication` interface + factory `#ifdef` dispatch. Single concrete `OS::Application` class; per-platform impl in `LinuxApplication.cpp` / `OSXApplication.mm` / `Win32Application.cpp` (selected via `#if defined(PLATFORM_*)`). `CreateApplication()` returns `unique_ptr<Application>`. Engine owns `unique_ptr<OS::Application>`.
- **Step B (`5e9eaed`)** — Window: dropped `IWindow` interface. Single concrete `OS::Window` class with compact header (no platform includes); per-platform impl in `LinuxWindow.cpp` / `OSXWindow.mm` / `Win32Window.cpp`. `CreateWindow()` returns `unique_ptr<Window>`. OSX member `nsWindow` generalized to `osHandle`. Removed obsolete per-platform Window/Application headers.

### Verification
- `EngineTest`: **52/52 PASS, 0 FAIL** (test-config build).
- `WindowTest`: all runtime cases PASS (Create/Title/Size/Visibility/Poll Events) — concrete `Window` works end-to-end.

### Known / pre-existing (NOT a regression)
- Building with the global `-D__TEST__ -D__UNIT_TEST__` flag (the `./build.sh -test` path) pulls the test framework into *every* app via `Window.cpp`'s `WindowTest`, creating a pre-existing `OSAL ↔ Test` static-lib circular dependency. With `Test` linked last, `EngineTest` links fine but thin apps like `WindowExample` fail to link (missing `Logger`/`Memory` symbols). This is a build-ordering property orthogonal to the refactor — `WindowExample` links cleanly in a normal non-test config. No build files were changed for it (per AGENTS.md, generated CMakeLists are not hand-edited).

### Questions Addressed

1. **What is String SSO?**
   Small String Optimization (SSO) stores small strings (typically ≤15-22 chars) directly in the string object instead of allocating heap memory. This avoids allocation overhead for common cases and improves cache locality. Standard `std::string` implement SSO.

2. **LinkedList Node Pooling Check**
   Yes, verified: LinkedList uses a template allocator parameter (`TAllocator = DefaultAllocator<LinkedListNode<TType>>`). Unit tests specifically configure it with PoolAllocator:
   ```cpp
   PoolAllocator alloc("LinkedListTest::Allocator", NodeSize, COUNT + 10);
   AllocatorScope allocScope(alloc);
   ```
   Despite node pooling, performance issues may stem from:
   - Pointer chasing causing poor cache locality
   - Algorithm inefficiencies beyond allocation
   - Test configuration or measurement overhead

3. **MultiPoolAllocator Locking**
   Correct: 
   - `MultiPoolAllocator` (single-threaded): No mutex locks
   - `ThreadSafeMultiPoolAllocator`: Contains `std::mutex lock` for thread safety

4. **HString and SSO**
   Verified: `HString = std::basic_string<char, ..., hbe::DefaultAllocator<char>>` 
   As a typedef of `std::basic_string`, it inherits the standard library's SSO implementation (when available on the platform).
   The poor-performing string in tests was the custom `String` class (Engine/String/String.h), not HString.

### Key Clarification
The StringTest warning referred to the custom `String` class (always heap-allocated via `Shareable<Vector<TChar>>`), not HString which does benefit from std::string's SSO.
