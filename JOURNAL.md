## Summary of Macro Application Task

Applied the new macros from `Engine/Core/CommonMacros.h` across the codebase:
- `returnIf(condition)` for `if (condition) return;`
- `returnValueIf(value, condition)` for `if (condition) return value;`
- `breakIf(condition)` for `if (condition) break;`
- `continueIf(condition)` for `if (condition) continue;`
- `ONCE()` macro kept in CommonMacros.h (removed duplicate from CommonUtil.h)

### Changes Made

1. **Engine/Core/CommonMacros.h**: Added `returnValueIf` macro.
2. **Engine/Core/CommonUtil.h**: Removed duplicate `ONCE` macro definition.
3. Applied macros to 34 files across Container, Math, OSAL, Resource, String, Logger, ComponentSystem, TaskSystem, etc.
4. Added `#include "Core/CommonMacros.h"` to each modified file.
5. Verified that all 51 unit tests pass.

### Lines Saved Estimate

- Approximately 103 macro applications replaced 2-line patterns with 1-line equivalents, saving ~103 lines.
- Added 34 include lines (one per modified file).
- Removed 1 duplicate macro line from CommonUtil.h.
- **Net lines saved**: 103 - 34 + 1 = **70 lines**.

### Verification

- Built and ran EngineTest in Debug configuration: all tests pass.
- No regressions introduced.

## RingQueue Performance Optimization & Quaternion Test Fix

### Changes Made

1. **Engine/Container/RingQueue.h**:
   - Added `#include <bit>` for `std::bit_ceil()`
   - Modified constructor to round capacity to next power of 2 using `std::bit_ceil()`
   - Changed `WrapIndex` from modulo (`% cap`) to bitmask (`& (cap - 1)`)
3. **Engine/Math/Quaternion.cpp**:
   - Previous expectation was mathematically invalid (rotating vector parallel to axis of rotation)
